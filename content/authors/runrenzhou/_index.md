Hi there! My name is Runren Zhou, and I am a pre-doctoral research fellow of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC-China). I have a keen interest in labor economics, political economy, and economic history. 
Currently, I'm engaging in several research projects, involving the impact of sparrow killing on ecology and demography, social mobility of Jinshi scholars during the Ming and Qing dynasties and a forthcoming RCT about land merge in China. I've also completed some personal research projects which are listed below.
