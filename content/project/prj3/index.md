title: "Population Mobility in Ethnic Minority Areas of China"
summary: "Using the 20% subsample from 2005 National 1% Population Sampling Survey, the project studies the factors affecting the population movement of ethnic minorities in China. The results show that living in compact communities of ethnic minorities would reduce the willingness of individuals
in ethnic groups to move to other prefectures. Also, lower proficiency in Mandarin leads to less population movement, and ethnic compact communities would influence local language in education and religious forces, thus affecting people's choice of migration."
