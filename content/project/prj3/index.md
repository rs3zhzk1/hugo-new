Using the 20% subsample from 2005 National 1% Population Sampling Survey, this project studies the factors affecting the population movement of ethnic minorities in China with binary probit model and instrument variable method. The results show that living in compact communities of ethnic minorities would reduce the willingness of individuals in ethnic groups to move to other prefectures.  

Possible explanations are: 1.the living pattern increases the closedness of ethnic groups; 2.the living pattern reflects the in complete integration of ethnic regions by Central Plain Dynasty in history, an effect that still exists today.  

The study also finds that lower proficiency in Mandarin leads to less population movement, and ethnic compact communities would influence local language in education and religious forces, thus affecting peopleâ€™s choice of migration.
