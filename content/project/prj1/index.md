title: 'aaWhen Labor Supply is not Self-determined: A New Perspective to Understand the Determinant of Wage and Overtime Work'
summary: This study builds a model to depict the labor market which makes a distinction between number of workers and working hours. In this context, supply of the number of workers is inelastic and each firm will propose a bundle composed of wage rate and working hours to attract laborers. The equilibrium is achieved by the competition about the utility reflected by the bundles among firms. The results demonstrate that such a market structure will reveal the actual determinants of wage and working hours, reversing the impacts of labor demand side shock and firm's productivity.
