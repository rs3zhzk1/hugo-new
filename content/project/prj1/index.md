title: 'Non-self-determined Labor Supply and Overtime Work'
summary: A labor market where workers can only choose the packages offered by firms but not supply their labor freely can be more realistic and such market structure would reverse the impacts of labor demand side shock and firms' productivity.

This paper builds a model to depict the labor market which makes a distinction between number of workers and working hours. In this context, supply of the number of workers is inelastic and each firm will propose a bundle composed of wage rate and working hours to attract laborers. Workers just choose the favorite the bundles and work for the corresponding firms. The equilibrium is achieved by the competition about the utility reflected by the bundles among firms.  

The results demonstrate that under such a market structure, the positive shock of labor demand side and higher overall productivity of firms will reduce the equilibrium working hours, which is opposite to the canonical models. Also, the labor supply curve evaluated by instrument variables is misleading as the correlation between wage rate and working hours can't reflect the preference of workers any more. All of the results remind us that we need to clarify the actual structure of the labor market before the empirical analysis.  

What's more, this study points out that overtime can be utilized by firms to achieve a more flexible adjustment of labor input with lower cost. However, the impacts on employees' welfare deserve further research.
