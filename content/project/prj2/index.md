title: "Text Similarity of Work Reports of China's Central-local Governments"
summary: "Using two corpora, work reports of China's central and local governments from 2002 to 2018, this project studies the change of their similarity over the years together with the details of the convergent content. The results demonstrate that the change of central-local similarity before 2013 is relatively flat and ambiguous while there has been a steep increase since 2013. Also, the percent of ideological content is stable before 2012 but has begun to soar since 2013."
