Using two corpora, work reports of China’s central and local governments from 2002 to 2018, this project studies the change of their similarity over the years together with the details of the convergent content. Besides the standard text processing and descriptive statistics, dictionary methods, wordfish model and k-means clustering are also applied. The results demonstrate that the change of central-local similarity before 2013 is relatively flat and ambiguous while there has been a steep increase since 2013.  

To explore the source of similarity, this study extracts the same words from each local government’s work reports in each year and the central government’s work report in that year, and use the constructed dictionary of ideological terms to calculate the percentage of ideological words in them. Similar to the results of similarity, the percentage of ideological words doesn’t not change much before 2012, but increases from less than 10% to more than 20% after 2012.
